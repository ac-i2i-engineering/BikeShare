# BikeShare
The Bike Share System is a platform that leverages G-Suite automation through Google Apps Script to streamline bike checkouts, returns, and inventory management.

# Design
The database in relational model.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design

#### Core Classes:
1. **DatabaseManager** - Base class for all database operations with Google Sheets
2. **Bike** - Represents individual bikes with their status and operations
3. **User** - Represents system users with their checkout history and status
4. **CheckoutLog** - Handles checkout form submissions and validation
5. **ReturnLog** - Handles return form submissions and validation  
6. **Report** - Generates system snapshots and analytics
7. **BikeShareService** - Main service layer that orchestrates all operations

**Encapsulation:**
- Each class encapsulates its data and related operations
- Private methods handle internal logic while public methods provide clean interfaces
- Database operations are abstracted through the DatabaseManager class

**Inheritance & Composition:**
- All model classes use DatabaseManager for data persistence
- Log classes inherit common functionality while implementing specific validation

**Polymorphism:**
- Static factory methods (fromSheetRow, fromFormResponse) create objects from different data sources
- Uniform interfaces for save() operations across all model classes

**Single Responsibility:**
- Bike class handles bike-specific operations (checkout, return, maintenance)
- User class manages user-specific data and operations
- Service class orchestrates business logic without knowing database details
- Log classes handle form processing and validation

#### Implementation Benefits:

1. **Maintainability:** Clear class boundaries make code easier to update and debug
2. **Reusability:** Classes can be easily extended for new features
3. **Testing:** Each class can be unit tested independently
4. **Scalability:** New bike types or user roles can be added through inheritance
5. **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling with proper exception propagation
