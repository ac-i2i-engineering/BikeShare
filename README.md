## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design

#### Core Classes:
1. **DatabaseManager** - Base class for all database operations with Google Sheets
2. **Bike** - Represents individual bikes with their status and operations
3. **User** - Represents system users with their checkout history and status
4. **CheckoutLog** - Handles checkout form submissions and validation
5. **ReturnLog** - Handles return form submissions and validation  
6. **Report** - Generates system snapshots and analytics

## Bike Names to Hash Spreadsheet Formula
To convert bike names to hash values, use the following formula in Google Sheets:
```excel
=UPPER(CONCAT(DEC2HEX(MOD(SUM(CODE(MID(A10,ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(A10))),1)))*13, 4096),3), DEC2HEX(MOD(SUM(CODE(MID(A10,ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(A10))),1)))*LEN(A10)*7, 4096),3)))
```
## Pre-fill link creation for Google Forms
To create pre-filled links for Google Forms, use the following format:
```excel
="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/FORM_ID/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.FIELD_ID=" & A1
```
Replace `FORM_ID` with your form's ID and `FIELD_ID` with the specific field ID you want to pre-fill. The value in cell `A1` will be automatically filled in the form.

## Generate QR Codes for URLS
To generate QR codes for URLs, you can use the following Google Sheets formula:
```excel
=IMAGE("https://quickchart.io/qr?text="&ENCODEURL(N2))
```
Replace `N2` with the cell containing the URL you want to convert into a QR code. This will generate a QR code image that can be scanned to access the URL directly.
